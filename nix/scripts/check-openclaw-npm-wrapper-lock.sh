# Prove the gateway npm wrapper package-lock.json can be consumed without the
# registry before anything builds from it. `npm ci` does not validate nested
# edges: when the lock mis-resolves or lacks a transitive package (an in-place
# update of the previous release's lock leaves e.g. a stale nested p-limit@2 as
# the target of a new openclaw -> p-limit@^7 edge), npm silently re-resolves it
# against the registry, which surfaces later as an opaque ENOTCACHED inside the
# Nix sandbox. Running the same resolver offline against an empty cache, in a
# scratch copy, fails on exactly those edges while still accepting subtrees that
# upstream pins through npm-shrinkwrap.json (which npm never re-resolves). The
# scratch lock must also come back byte-identical: `npm ci` consumes the
# committed lock as-is, so a lock npm silently repairs offline is not proven.
